Malicious C programs - Sean Foley and Leon Lam

We intend to make a bunch of C programs which, when run, do various horrific things to the computer they are running on. Our minimum viable product will be something that is impossible to kill with ctrl-c when run. We eventually hope to produce a "pick your poison" app which offers the user a choice of horrible fates, explains what is about to happen, and then ruins the computer it's running on.

From this, we hope to learn about the underlying architecture of the operating system and how programs interact with it. We also hope to instill (both in ourselves and whoever else sees this) a healthy suspicion of executable files whose contents are unknown.

We need knowledge of operating system architecture and existing exploits, which we are decently sure can be found on the internet. We also need a testing environment which neither of us will miss if rendered inoperable. 

We intend to start researching how to mess with computers, acquiring a testing environment which is representative of an actual computer but easy to set up and tear down, and implementing exploits or malicious code. Throughout the project, we will continue research into exploits and malicious programs and iterate on the code that we write.
